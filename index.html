<p>Welcome to Brno!</p>
<p>City for students in Czech Republic.</p>
<p>    The etymology of the name Brno is disputed. It might be derived from the Old Czech brnie 'muddy, swampy.’Alternative</p>
<p> derivations are from a Slavic verb brniti (to armour or to fortify) or a Celtic language spoken in the area before it was
  overrun</p>
<p> by Germanic peoples and later Slavic peoples (this theory would make it cognate with other Celtic words for hill, 
  such as the </p>
<p>Welsh word bryn).
  
  Throughout its history, Brno's locals also referred to the town in other languages, including Brünn in German,</p>
<p> ברין (Brin) in Yiddish and Bruna in Latin. The city was also referred to as Brunn (English: /brʌn/) in English, but this usage is not </p>
<p>common today. </p>
