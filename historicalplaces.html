      <img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" src="img\joaquins-erasmus-experience-en-brno-czech-republic-ab0d7004b052945f0e43dbc04a332f78.jpg" width="300" height="201" alt="cathedral">
      <p></p>
      <p style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); color:#903;">Perched atop Petrov Hill in the heart of Brno, the Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul is considered a national cultural monument and remains one of the city's most important attractions due to its splendid architecture. Highlights include its exquisite Baroque interior, as well as the 84-meter-tall twin towers added at the start of the 20th century (the main part of the building dates from the mid-1700s). Try to time your visit to coincide with the ringing of the midday bells, which in fact sound at 11am (legend has it this early peel successfully tricked attacking Swedes into ending their siege). Another highlight is a chance to see the remnants of the original city walls buried underneath the cathedral, as well as its interesting old crypt.</p>

    <section class="col-lg-4" style="text-align:center;"> <h3 style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); color:#690;">2. Špilberk Castle and the Brno City Museum</h3>
      <img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" src="img\71b48167e5e8de201585d2ad4978fa09.jpg" width="300" height="135" alt="castle">
      <p></p><p style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); color:#903;">Dating from the 13th century, Špilberk Castle (hrad Špilberk) was built by Czech King Pøemysl Otakar II and has served many roles over the years, including those of royal castle, fortress, and prison. Today, the castle is home to the Brno City Museum with its fine permanent and frequent temporary exhibitions. Permanent exhibits focus on the architectural history of the castle and its role as a prison, as well as the history of Brno. Concerts, theatrical performances, and other cultural events are held in the castle's courtyard throughout the summer, and visitors are also encouraged to climb the lookout tower for its fine views over the old city.</p>

      <img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" src="img\czech-republic-brno-moravian-karst-caves.jpg" width="300" height="198" alt="caves">
      <p></p><p style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); color:#903;">Famous for its cool air and stunning caverns, the Moravian Karst and Caves are a must-visit when in Brno. The Karst area covers some 100 square kilometers and contains more than 1,100 known caves and gorges, four of which are open to the public for self-guided tours (trails are clearly marked indicating their level of difficulty). For the truly adventurous, a number of less-traveled caverns can be visited with a qualified spelunker as a guide. Highlights include numerous interesting stalagmites and stalactites easily viewable from the well-lit passageways, as well as an excellent boat tour along an underground river. Also of note is the Macocha Abyss, a deep chasm overlooked by viewing platforms and footbridges, and with numerous excellent walking trails. About 25 kilometers north of Brno, the caves are always popular with tourists, so be sure to book your visit in advance.</p>

      <img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" src="img\czech-republic-brno-dietrichstein-palace-moravian-museum.jpg" width="300" height="203" alt="museum">
      <p></p><p style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); color:#903;">The Dietrichstein Palace (Dietrichstinsky Palac), built in the early 17th century for Cardinal Dietrichstein, is typical of Brno's splendid baroque architecture style. Today, the palace houses the excellent Moravian Museum (Moravské zemské muzeum), the country's oldest museum (and one of the largest) and home to more than six million historical artifacts. The museum's five permanent exhibits cover a wide range of topics and time periods, including prehistory, a Moravian village in the Middle Ages, and minerals and mining, as well as offering a comprehensive overview of the region's more recent history, including fascinating displays relating to WWI and WWII.</p>

      <img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" src="img\640px-Brno,_hrad_Veveří_a_lávka_2.JPG" width="300" height="178" alt="castle2">
      <p></p><p style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); color:#903;">Just 15 kilometers northwest of Brno's city center, Veveří Castle's good looks are enhanced by its commanding position high above the River Svratka. Founded in the 11th century, this stunning structure's present appearance features numerous additions and changes made up until the medieval period. After changing hands and nationality many times - the castle was once even owned by wealthy English landlords, and hosted Winston Churchill in his younger years - the castle lay dormant for decades, but thanks to recent renovations is certainly worth a visit. Highlights include the palace building with its vast loft and dining room, its fine frescoes, and collections of furniture. (English language guided tours are available.)</p>
